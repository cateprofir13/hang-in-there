# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a motivational poster generator web application. Users can view randomly generated motivational posters, create their own by entering a custom image, title, and quote, save their favorites, and view them in a separate saved posters section. It also includes a special feature for viewing and managing "unmotivational" posters which users can delete if they prefer.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
The steps a person should take are:
-Clone the Repository
-Navigate into the project folder
-Open the project in a code editor
-Open the index.html file in a browser

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am a Mod 2 student, currently in my second week, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked on this project every day for the past 10 days, averaging about 3 hours a day.
### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals for this project were: 
- Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
- Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I was able to implement concepts I had just learned in class, so my understanding aligned well with the tasks in the project. I collaborated with my cohort mates and instructors to overcome challenges I encountered. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact to create beautiful and dynamic applications.
